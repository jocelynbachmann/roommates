# Roommates

The Roommates app helps users track groceries and expiring food, meal plan, and divide up chores. Anyone looking for an easy, consolidated way to manage their household chores, whether living alone or with roommates/family, can use the Roommates app to get timely notifications on things like groceries running low or expiring, or chores that need to be done. Users can also generate and save recipes based on their grocery items, which can be automatically entered by uploading images of items or receipts. Future functionality may include a budgeting section where users can divide expenses between members of their household.
