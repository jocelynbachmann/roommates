# Grocery page

## Current features
- master list of all groceries as sortable, filterable table
- quantity can be adjusted in list
- ability to edit each grocery item
- ability to create expiry and restocking notifications
- ability to mark favourites to prevent them from being deleted when qty reaches 0
- drawer to quickly show what is in each category and location


## Bugs and missing features
- currently expiry notifications and restocking notifications are deletable chores that show up in the calendar page (should not be there)
- when trying to save an invalid name while editing a grocery item, it closes the popup even though it doesn't save the error
- lots more ahhhhh
